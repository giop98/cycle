BIKLE is a modified (unofficial) version of Wordle, the enigmistic game in which you have to guess a word of 5 letters in 6 tries. Differently from Wordle, BIKLE uses surnames of cyclists. 

It's a game for cycling fans.

To create it, we used the code of Pietro Peterlongo and of Mauro Munafo, authors of PAROLE and KASTA.
